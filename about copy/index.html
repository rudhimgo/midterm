    <p>Hello! My name is Rudhi Gokhale and I am from San Francisco, California. I am currently selling my clothes. Simply put, I've noticed that I have an extravagant surplus of clothing in my closet. Most of them are clothes I never even use. And for what purpose? To sit in my bedroom, lamenting the fact that they will never be worn and will probably spend the remainder of their lifespan locked away in a closet until I finally decide to donate it. Well this shall happen no longer! I am selling any brand-new or gently used clothes that I own. There is nothing wrong with these clothes. In fact, they are probably just as good as what you would get in a store. And cheaper too! So instead of trekking yourself out to the mall or local boutiques for a wuick shopping spree, why not come down to this handy dandy 'ol website and browse to your hearts content! Reach out to me through the Contact page if any questions arise. Happy shopping!</p>
